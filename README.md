# Admee - An Advertisement Platform

### Problem Statement:
A Client needs a Discourse web application for the Advertisement, where the user can come and publish his advertisement. 

### Solution:
Here I have built a web application which will solve the given problem statement. 
The frontend part is written in HTML, CSS, Java Script, Bootstrap. And the backend is in Python. The database is SQL. The name of the website is 'ADMEE'

#### The front page or the index page:

Here If the user clicks on the ‘Get Started’ button, he/she will be redirected to the home page.  Here the user is allowed to see the content without login. They need to login if they want to post any advertisement. And if the user wants to login from the first page, then they can. They can also create a new account through ‘Create Account’ button. If an existing user forgot their password, then they can click ‘Forgot Password’ button.

This is the home page of the website. Here we can see the advertiser, Product Name, Brand Name and the description about the product. To create a new Advertisement, the user needs to press ‘Create a new account’ button. Here all the without login user will be redirected to the login page and all the logged in user will be redirected to the ‘Create Advertisement’ page. 

Suppose the user is not logged In. So, the login Page will look like this.

From here they can login. If they want to create new account, they need to click ‘Create Account’.
